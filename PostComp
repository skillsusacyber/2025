Firstly, 
I want to congratulate everyone on how they did in the competition, showing up and meeting the challenge especially unknown takes grit, so for that I commend you.
It is always good to see familiar faces in the competition so I encourage everyone to compete again next year. 
Remember to network with one another, the Cybersecurity Community is very small so I promise you will cross paths with one another once again. 
I want to thank everyone for their feedback to make the competition improve and refine some of the components. Every bit to improve helps!
For the Students that are going to transition out of Secondary or Post Secondary and are interested in the Judging or want to be involved behind the scenes feel free to reach out. 
I always want to remind everyone that Cybersecurity remains this umbrella term, wide in nature and endlessly subjective at points. 
Continue to use the learning platforms , TryHackMe, HackTheBox, NationalCyberLeague, LetsDefend, PicoCTF, etc and dip your toes in different subject areas. You will be suprised to see how much you grow.

I'll be updating this repo for general info and also sending indiviudal feedback via email. 

Good luck today and dont forget to take pictures!
